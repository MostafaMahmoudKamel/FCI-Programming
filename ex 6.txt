/*
(Factorials) The factorial function is used frequently in probability problems.
The factorial of a positive integer n (written n! and pronounced “n factorial”)
is equal to the product of the positive integers from 1 to n. Write a program that evaluates
the factorials of the integers from 1 to 5. Print the results in tabular format.
What difficulty might prevent you from calculating the factorial of 20?
