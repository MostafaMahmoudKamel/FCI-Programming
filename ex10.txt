/*
Write a program to print Fibonacci series of n terms
, where n is input by user. The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence where the next term
is the sum of the previous two terms. The first two terms of the Fibonacci sequence are 0 followed 
by 1. For Example: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ... , (n-1th + n-2th)
